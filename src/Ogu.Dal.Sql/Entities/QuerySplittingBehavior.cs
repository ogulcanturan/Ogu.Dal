        //     This behavior can significantly improve performance when the query loads multiple
        //     collections. However, since separate queries are used, this can result in inconsistent
        //     results when concurrent updates occur. Serializable or snapshot transactions
        //     can be used to mitigate this and achieve consistency with split queries, but
        //     that may bring other performance costs and behavioral difference.
